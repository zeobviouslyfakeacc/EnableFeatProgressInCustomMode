# EnableFeatProgressInCustomMode

[Mod Loader](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller/) mod for *The Long Dark*

### Description

The v1.29 update turned off Feat progress in custom mode games.

Considering that feats can even be achieved in Pilgrim, and seeing how custom mode games can only get more challenging than Pilgrim, this change makes absolutely no sense.

So I made a mod that turns Feat progress back on again.
