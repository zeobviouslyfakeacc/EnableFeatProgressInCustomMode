# EnableFeatProgressInCustomMode

This mod for The Long Dark re-enables feat progress in custom mode games, which had been disabled in the v1.29 update.

Custom mode games can only get more challenging than Pilgrim – in which players can achieve feats – so it
makes little sense that feat progress would be disabled in custom mode games.
